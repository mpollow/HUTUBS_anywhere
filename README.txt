This project allows to derive HRTF datasets from the HUTUBS database for any desired set of directions. It uses the HRIR representation given as SH-coefficients and converts them to a NumPy array for a given set of angles (theta, phi). 

The folder HUTUBS_HRIRs (as used in the test function) contains the unzipped dataset of HRIRs (HRIRs.zip) as found on the project website at
